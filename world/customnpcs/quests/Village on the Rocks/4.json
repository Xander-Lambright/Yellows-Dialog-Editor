After speaking with the chief of Shilo, I discovered that they are on some hard times. They have something called an Evergrow tree, which is very important to them, that they cannot get to because of a flood. Also, their lighthouse has burnt out, with the keeper nowhere to be found.

Because I am apparently, peculiar, they sent me to find a strange man who claims that he can forge me into someone who can help their plight.

He is south-west of Shilo Village, there should be a path of rocks and isles that I can follow without needing a boat.",
